# Ansible Role: Filebeat for ELK Stack

[![CI](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-filebeat/workflows/CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-filebeat/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

An Ansible Role that installs [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats/filebeat) on RedHat/CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    filebeat_version: 7.x # for Linux only

Controls the major version of Filebeat which is installed.

    filebeat_package: filebeat
    filebeat_package_state: present

The specific package to be installed. You can specify a version of the package using the correct syntax for your platform and package manager by changing the package name. You can also control the package state (e.g. present, absent, or latest).

    filebeat_create_config: true

Whether to create the Filebeat configuration file and handle the copying of SSL key and cert for filebeat. If you prefer to create a configuration file yourself you can set this to `false`.

    filebeat_inputs:
      - type: log
        paths:
          - "/var/log/*.log"

Inputs that will be listed in the `inputs` section of the Filebeat configuration. Read through the [Filebeat Inputs configuration guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/configuration-filebeat-options.html) for more options.

    filebeat_output_elasticsearch_enabled: false
    filebeat_output_elasticsearch_hosts:
      - "localhost:9200"

Whether to enable Elasticsearch output, and which hosts to send output to.

    filebeat_output_logstash_enabled: true
    filebeat_output_logstash_hosts:
      - "localhost:5000"

Whether to enable Logstash output, and which hosts to send output to.

    filebeat_enable_logging: false
    filebeat_log_level: warning
    filebeat_log_dir: /var/log/filebeat
    filebeat_log_filename: filebeat.log

Filebeat logging.

    filebeat_ssl_dir: /etc/pki/logstash

The path where certificates and keyfiles will be stored.

    filebeat_ssl_certificate_file: ""
    filebeat_ssl_key_file: ""

Local paths to the SSL certificate and key files, which will be copied into the `filebeat_ssl_dir`.

For utmost security, you should use your own valid certificate and keyfile, and update the `filebeat_ssl_*` variables in your playbook to use your certificate.

To generate a self-signed certificate/key pair, you can use use the command:

    $ sudo openssl req -x509 -batch -nodes -days 3650 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout filebeat.key -out filebeat.crt

Note that filebeat and logstash may not work correctly with self-signed certificates unless you also have the full chain of trust (including the Certificate Authority for your self-signed cert) added on your server. See: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/4926#issuecomment-203936891

    filebeat_ssl_insecure: "false"

Set this to `"true"` to allow the use of self-signed certificates (when a CA isn't available).

### Windows-specific variables

Due to different ways to package installation and service management in Windows some specific variables can be set:
    filebeat_windows_version: 7.10.2 # exact version or 'latest'
    filebeat_windows_configdir: 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\filebeat\tools\' # directory to store Filebeat config file

### Overriding the filebeat template

If you can't customize via variables because an option isn't exposed, you can override the template used to generate the filebeat configuration.

    filebeat_template: "filebeat.yml.j2"

You can either copy and modify the provided template, or you can, for example, point to a template file in your playbook directory that will be used instead of the managed template.

    filebeat_template: "{{ playbook_dir }}/templates/filebeat.yml.j2"

## Dependencies

None.

## Example Playbook

    - hosts: logs
    
    - name: Set the java_packages variable (Debian/Ubuntu).
      set_fact:
        java_packages:
          - openjdk-8-jdk
      when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'
    
      roles:
        - geerlingguy.java
        - geerlingguy.elasticsearch
        - geerlingguy.logstash
        - geerlingguy.filebeat
